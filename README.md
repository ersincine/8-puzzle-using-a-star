# 8-puzzle-using-a-star
8-puzzle problem solving using A* algorithm (MATLAB and Python code available)

MATLAB code is unfortunately in Turkish (If somebody needs it and creates an issue, I will translate the code into English.). 

For solving a random problem:

	SekizTasCoz(0);

For solving a specific problem, for example:

	SekizTasCoz( [0 1 3 ; 7 8 6 ; 2 4 5] );
  
This code produces shorter paths compare to this program: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21154-application-of-artificial-intelligence-a-puzzle-8
